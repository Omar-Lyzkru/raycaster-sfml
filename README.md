# Raycaster in SFML

This is a simple 3D raycasting engine written in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).  
It simulates a first-person view using raycasting, inspired by early 3D games such as Wolfenstein 3D.

## Features
- First-person rendering using raycasting
- Real-time movement with keyboard input
- Basic wall shading based on distance
- Graphical window rendering using SFML

## Technologies
- C++
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

## Controls
- `W` / `S`: Move forward and backward
- `A` / `D`: Rotate left and right

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omar-Lyzkru/raycaster-sfml.git
